# old_newpaper_project
This repository is built for Old Newspaper Project which applies deep learning means to convert scanned photos of newspaper to machine-encoded text.

To achieve the goal, we need to collect training data, build models and perform experiments. Up to now, we decide to use Faster RCNN model in Detectron2 Model Zoo to perform object detection and OCR for text scanning.
